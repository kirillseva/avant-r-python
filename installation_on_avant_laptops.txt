The following instructions worked for my machine and are copied here essentially from memory.  
This information was primary gathered from the internet and/or in discussions with 
various Avantees.

# The process in a nut-shell.
# 1. download the git hub repo for xgboost somewhere
#    on your local machine.
# 2. get gcc49
# 3. build xgboost
# 4. also install scikit-learn

# So … 1. is left to you.
#
# FYI, the instructions at dmlc/xgboost
# ask you to use `pip install xgboost`.
# This did not work for me because I could not
# find a way to specify a specific version of 
# gcc (gcc49 in this case) to use with pip.
# BTW, this did not work also:
# env CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9


# 2. get and install gcc49
# To install gcc, you need to
# first, ensure that you have given yourself
# permissions on key folders

# here’s where I needed them.
# copy the same commands for wherever else you
# may get the `permission denied` error

sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/share
brew install gcc49


# 3. Build xgboost.
#
# Edit Makefile
# and point to your newly installed
# gcc-4.9 and g++-4.9 explicitly
# Here’s how I did mine.
#
# Original Version
#export CC  = $(if $(shell which gcc-5),gcc-5,gcc)
#export CXX = $(if $(shell which g++-5),g++-5,g++)
#
# My edit
#export CC  = /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9
#export CXX = /usr/local/bin/g++-4.9
#
# Then

./build.sh

# go into python directory and
python setup.py install

# may need to add yourself as admin on /Library/python folder
# as well (see above)


# 4. Also needs scikit-learn
#
# Almost there.  xgboost wants ‘scikit-learn’
# Fortunately, pip works in this case.

pip install scikit-learn

Happy boosting.
